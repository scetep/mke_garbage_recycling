# mke_garbage_recycling
A Home Assistant custom integration for the city of Milwaukee, WI to pull next garbage and recycling dates. 

## Overview
This module is written with the help of reference documents and Google Gemini 2.5 AI. It did a decent job taking my existing PowerShell API script and changing it into Python and HA compatible code. I am intending to use this to create a automation at home that lets me know to get my sleepy butt up and run stuff out to the curb before the garbage men notice I am awake. The reason for that is if there is any chance they know I am awake they will speed dash my neighborhood and miss all my junk. I hope this helps you too.

## Feedback
I would love to have any if anyone has any advice on how to make this more functional.
